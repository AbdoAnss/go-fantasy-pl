// Allowlists codify which FPL API keys each model deliberately does not map.
//
// The conformance rules (see internal/conformance) fail on any payload key
// without a model field, so every key the API returns but we choose not to
// expose must be listed here. Each entry is an explicit, reviewable decision;
// when the API adds keys, conformance failures tell you exactly what to add
// where — the model, if we want the data, or this file, if we don't.
//
// Last reconciled against the live API on 2026-08-15 (2026/27 pre-season).
